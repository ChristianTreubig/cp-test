# cp-test

## Setup

Create and activate a virtual environment (I developed the application using Python 3.6.12).

Install requirements:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run migrations:  
`cd cp_project`  
`python manage.py migrate`

Start the server:  
`python manage.py runserver`

Visit the home page; you'll need to sign up a new user to get started:  
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
